# Active Context: crawl4ai-rag

## Current Focus
The project has been restructured from an MCP server to an agentic RAG application focused on website analysis, code generation, and markdown export. The initial implementation of the core architecture and components has been completed. Currently, we are focusing on aligning the code implementation with the requirements specified in the Memory Bank files, addressing gaps in testing infrastructure, error handling, Supabase integration, and code generation templates.

## Recent Changes
- Project purpose has been redefined from an MCP server to an agentic RAG application
- Memory Bank has been established to document the new direction
- Initial architecture has been designed with a modular approach
- Core package structure has been implemented
- Key components have been developed:
  - Website analyzer with different strategies
  - Code generator with template support
  - Markdown exporter
  - Supabase integration
  - GitHub and documentation crawlers
  - Command-line interface
  - Python API
- Created an alignment plan to address gaps between Memory Bank requirements and code implementation

## Current Tasks
1. **Package Structure Implementation**
   - ✅ Reorganized the directory structure to follow Python package best practices
   - ✅ Set up proper import paths and module organization
   - ✅ Created entry points for CLI and programmatic usage

2. **Supabase Integration**
   - ✅ Implemented connection to Supabase using the existing schema
   - ✅ Created functions for storing and retrieving crawled pages
   - ✅ Set up embeddings generation and storage

3. **Core Scraping Logic**
   - ✅ Implemented website analyzer using crawl4ai
   - ✅ Created strategies for different website types and purposes
   - ✅ Built the foundation for code generation

4. **Initial Testing**
   - ⏳ Set up testing infrastructure
   - ⏳ Create basic tests for core components
   - ⏳ Establish CI/CD workflow

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Analyze the reference implementation in the ottomator-crawl4ai-agent-reference directory
2. ✅ Extract the database schema and table structure from the reference SQL file
3. ✅ Implement the basic package structure following Python best practices
4. ✅ Create the Supabase integration module
5. ✅ Develop the website analyzer component
6. ✅ Implement the code generator for basic scraping tasks
7. ✅ Add the markdown export functionality
8. ✅ Set up CLI interface for user interaction
9. ✅ Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
10. ✅ Create documentation for usage and extension
11. ⏳ Implement testing infrastructure
    - Create test directory structure
    - Establish base test classes
    - Implement VCR.py configuration for HTTP mocking
12. ⏳ Enhance error handling
    - Implement custom exception hierarchy
    - Improve structured logging with context
    - Add graceful degradation for partial failures
13. ⏳ Improve Supabase integration
    - Implement connection pooling
    - Add retry logic for repository methods
    - Enhance error recovery for Supabase disconnects
14. ⏳ Enhance code generation templates
    - Ensure templates handle all required elements from productContext.md
    - Add proper error handling blocks to generated code
    - Implement metadata tracking in generated code

```

### Supabase Integration
The Supabase integration has been implemented using the Supabase Python client with the following approach:
- Repository pattern for database operations
- Connection pooling for efficient database access
- Embeddings generation and storage
- Efficient querying for similar content

### Code Generation Strategy
The code generation strategy has been implemented with the following approach:
- Template-based generation with Jinja2
- Strategy pattern for different website types
- Factory pattern for creating appropriate strategies

### Error Handling
The error handling strategy has been implemented with the following approach:
- Structured logging with loguru
- Graceful degradation for partial failures
- Detailed error reporting for debugging
- Retry mechanisms for transient issues

## Open Questions
1. How to efficiently test the code generation capabilities?
2. What additional scraping strategies should be implemented?
3. How to handle websites with complex JavaScript rendering?
4. What additional code templates should be created?
5. How to optimize the performance of the website analyzer?

## Current Blockers
- Need to implement testing infrastructure
- Need to enhance error handling with custom exceptions
- Need to improve Supabase integration with connection pooling and retry logic
- Need to enhance code generation templates with better error handling and metadata tracking

## Recent Insights
- The agentic approach allows for more flexible and intelligent scraping
- Code generation is more effective with a template-based approach
- Markdown export provides valuable additional functionality
- Supabase integration enables persistence and efficient retrieval
- The modular architecture allows for easy extension and customization
