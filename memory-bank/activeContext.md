# Active Context: crawl4ai-rag

## Current Focus
The project has been restructured from an MCP server to an agentic RAG application focused on website analysis, code generation, and markdown export. The initial implementation of the core architecture and components has been completed. Currently, we are focusing on enhancing the website analyzer with documentation-specific metrics and validation, improving error handling with custom exceptions, and preparing for code generation template enhancements. We have also implemented a GitHub-specific documentation scraper to better handle GitHub repositories.

## Recent Changes
- Enhanced the website analyzer with documentation-specific metrics:
  - Added API section detection
  - Implemented code block analysis by language and purpose
  - Added parameter table detection
  - Added documentation section identification
- Implemented documentation validation framework:
  - Created DocumentationError class hierarchy
  - Added validation for documentation structure
  - Added validation for code blocks
  - Implemented website-wide documentation analysis
- Improved error handling with custom exceptions and severity levels
- Added heuristic detection of documentation pages
- Created GitHub-specific documentation scraper:
  - Implemented GitHub-specific template (github_docs_scraper.j2)
  - Added GitHub documentation strategy
  - Updated CLI with GitHub-specific command
  - Added Supabase integration for GitHub documentation
- Updated dependencies:
  - Added pydantic-settings to support newer Pydantic versions
  - Fixed import issues in utils/logging.py

## Active Decisions

### Documentation Analysis Approach
We've implemented a comprehensive approach to documentation analysis:

1. **Detection Phase**: Identify if a page is likely documentation based on:
   - Title keywords (docs, reference, guide, etc.)
   - Content indicators (installation sections, API references, etc.)
   - Structural elements (code blocks, parameter tables, etc.)

2. **Analysis Phase**: Extract metrics about the documentation:
   - API section detection with start/end lines
   - Code block analysis by language and purpose
   - Parameter table detection
   - Section identification (installation, usage, API reference)

3. **Validation Phase**: Validate documentation quality:
   - Structure validation (headings, sections, etc.)
   - Code block validation (languages, purposes, etc.)
   - Error reporting with severity levels
   - Score calculation for overall quality

4. **Website-wide Analysis**: Aggregate documentation metrics across pages:
   - Identify all documentation pages
   - Calculate overall documentation quality
   - Identify gaps in documentation
   - Provide recommendations for improvement

### Error Handling Strategy
We've enhanced the error handling strategy with a more structured approach:

1. **Custom Exception Hierarchy**:
   - Base `DocumentationError` class
   - Severity levels (WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
   - Error codes for specific validation issues
   - Detailed error messages with context

2. **Validation Results Structure**:
   - Clear separation of errors and warnings
   - Scoring system for documentation quality
   - Percentage-based quality assessment
   - Gap identification for improvement recommendations

3. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Continue analysis even with partial validation failures
   - Provide as much useful information as possible
   - Clearly indicate which validations failed and why
   - Suggest improvements for failed validations

## Open Questions
1. How to efficiently test the documentation validation capabilities?
2. What additional documentation metrics would be valuable to extract?
3. How to handle documentation with non-standard formats?
4. What specialized code templates should be created for different documentation styles?
5. How to optimize the performance of the documentation analyzer for large documentation sites?
6. How to handle multilingual documentation?
7. What additional validation rules should be implemented for different types of documentation?

## Current Blockers
- Need to implement testing for the new documentation validation features
- Need to test the GitHub documentation scraper with the crawl4ai repository
- Need to resolve dependency issues with crawl4ai and other packages
- Need to improve Supabase integration with connection pooling and retry logic

## Recent Insights
- Documentation analysis requires a multi-faceted approach combining heuristics and pattern matching
- Validation should be flexible with different severity levels to accommodate various documentation styles
- Website-wide documentation analysis provides valuable insights beyond individual page analysis
- Code block analysis by language and purpose helps generate more targeted scraping code
- API section detection enables more precise extraction of API documentation
- Documentation quality can be quantified through a scoring system
