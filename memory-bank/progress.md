# Progress Tracking: crawl4ai-rag

## Project Status: Initial Implementation Phase (60% Complete)

The project has progressed from the initial planning phase to the implementation phase. The core architecture and components have been implemented, but testing and enhancements are still pending.

## What Works
- Project vision and architecture have been defined
- Memory Bank has been established to document the project
- Core package structure has been implemented
- Key components have been developed:
