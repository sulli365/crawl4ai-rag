# Progress Tracking: crawl4ai-rag

## Project Status: Enhancement Phase (80% Complete)

The project has progressed from the initial implementation phase to the enhancement phase. The core architecture and components have been implemented, and we are now enhancing specific components with more advanced features, particularly focusing on documentation analysis, validation, and MCP integration for improved GitHub repository handling. We have successfully implemented the GitHub MCP integration with enhanced configuration options and CLI improvements.

## What Works

  - Website analyzer with different strategies
  - Code generator with template support
  - Markdown exporter
  - Supabase integration
  - GitHub and documentation crawlers
  - Command-line interface
  - Python API
- Documentation analysis and validation:
  - API section detection
  - Code block analysis by language and purpose
  - Parameter table detection
  - Documentation quality validation
  - Website-wide documentation analysis
- GitHub-specific documentation scraping:
  - GitHub documentation scraper template
  - GitHub documentation strategy

  - Enhanced GitHubDocumentationStrategy using MCP
  - Updated GitHub documentation scraper template
  - CLI command for syncing GitHub repositories to Supabase
  - Fallback mechanisms for when MCP is unavailable

## What's In Progress
- Error handling enhancement for other components

  - Implemented file filtering based on extensions, include patterns, and exclude paths
  - Updated CLI to support multiple repositories via --repos option
  - Added direct communication with GitHub MCP server using npx
  - Improved error handling with fallback to mock responses
  - Started implementing subprocess-based approach for more reliable communication:
    - Created SubprocessManager for MCP server communication
    - Updated GitHubMcpService to use subprocess approach
    - Removed references to Cline's MCP implementation (cline.mcp)
    - Modified utils/mcp_client.py to use subprocess approach
    - Added proper request formatting for MCP server communication
    - Added timeout handling and improved error reporting
    - Still encountering challenges with subprocess communication
